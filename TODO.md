# TODO
* Allow for custom tilesets (currently only one tileset is partially supported)
* Allow for the background colour of characters to be changed
* Change makefile to output RogueTerm as a library rather than an executable
* Allow for resizable windows that update number of rows and columns inside the window
* Add ability to get the mouse position inside the window by character column and row
