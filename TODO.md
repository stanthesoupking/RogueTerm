# TODO
* Allow for custom tilesets (currently only one tileset is partially supported)
* ~~Allow for the background colour of characters to be changed~~ (Partially supported by using inverted fonts)
* Change makefile to output RogueTerm as a library rather than an executable
* ~~Allow for resizable windows that update number of rows and columns inside the window~~
* ~~Add ability to get the mouse position inside the window by character column and row~~ (Can be calculated easy enough with the `pixel_to_cell_coordinates(RT_Point2D pos)` function
* Add DPI scaling functionality
